# WRUW iPhone App

* Created by "Nick Jordan" <nkj7@case.edu>

This is the official iPhone app for [WRUW](http://www.wruw.org), the student-operated radio station at Case Western Reserve University.  WRUW plays "More Music, Fewer Hits".

The purpose of this app is to increase the global reach of listeners, as well as augment the listening experience for local listeners.  Users will be able to listen to the live stream, look at all playlist archives, and keep track of their favorite songs and programs.
