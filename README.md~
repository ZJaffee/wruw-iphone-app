# WRUW iPhone App
=================

* "Nick Jordan" <nkj7@case.edu>

This is the official iPhone app for [WRUW](wruw.org), the student-operated radio station at Case Western Reserve University.  WRUW plays "More Music, Fewer Hits". The app is set for launch on the App Store in time for Telethon, the annual donation drive in April.

The purpose of this app is to increase the global reach of listeners.  Users will be able to listen to the live stream, look at all playlist archives, and keep track of their favorite songs and programs they hear.
